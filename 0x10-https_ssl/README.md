This project involves 3 tasks
In this project,
- I add SSL certificate to my network connections(on my load balancer serving two webservers)
- I use SSL encript the communication between web browsers and my web server
- so that posible hackers can not intercept any information

## Project details
- Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let‚Äôs also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains. 

- ‚ÄúTerminating SSL on HAproxy‚Äù means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

- A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
