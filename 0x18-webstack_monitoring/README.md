- "You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure" is a famous saying in the Tech industry
- In the age of the data-ism,monitoring how our software systems are doing is an important thing
- In this project,I implement one of many tools to measure what is going on in my servers

Webstack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
- Application monitoring: Getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: Getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded(cloud
be CPU,memory,disk or network overload)
