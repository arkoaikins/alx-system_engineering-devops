## What i learnt in this project(explained briefly)
- In this project i learnt about Loops, conditions and parsing
- How to create SSH keys
  - Use the ssh-keygyen to open ssh key
- What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
  - #!/usr/bin/env bash  is flexible and portable to use
- How to use while, until and for loops
- How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
- How to use the cut command
  - used to extract specific parts (columns) of lines from files or the output of other commands
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
- How to use shellcheck
  - Shellcheck is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. 
  - It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about

## Project tasks
### 0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
Create a RSA key pair.

Requirements:
- Share your public key in your answer file 0-RSA_public_key.pub
- Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the public key you just generated

- Keep the private key to yourself in a secure location, you will use it later to connect to your servers using SSH. Some storing ideas are Dropbox, Goo  gle Drive, password manager, USB key. Failing to do so will prevent you to access your servers, which will prevent you from doing your projects

- If you decide to add a passphrase to your key, make sure to save this passphrase in a secure location, you will not be able to use your keys without t  he passphrase
- File: 0-RSA_public_key.pub
